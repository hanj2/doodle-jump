# CS 126 FinalProject

a doodle jump game using SFML external library
a simple game for entertainment

The player can control the doodle by the keys left, right, up, and down.
There are four types of platforms with different acceleration in the game: platforms with spring, platform which leads to the doodler turns into flying mode, wood platforms and normal platforms. There are two randomly appeared monsters. The doodler has three lives each time, hitting the ground or being attacked by the monster would cause one life to be lost.
The doodler can change its costume by stepping on different platforms.
At the end of the game, the score of the player will show on the screen and clicking arbitrary key will restart the game.
If the window is open for a certain amount of time, the window would be closed automatically.

Note: This game is a "recreation" of the original game in C++ and the graphics are from google images. I respect the original creators Igor Pusenjak and his brother for their great work.
